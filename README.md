# grad-replay
ARMA3 mission replay script (working but wip)
* Records player and AI movement and replays at end of mission.
* Meant for PvP but pimped to support AI as well
* Mission duration should be matched to replay precision (see below) - the longer the mission, the less precision is recommended. Better precision (smaller values) results in longer loading times.

### Required Mods
CBA, ACE3

# How to install
### 1. Download Release
### 2. extract GRAD_replay folder into [mission folder]/node_modules
### 3. Add the following to the description.ext

```
#include "node_modules\@gruppe-adler\replay\ui\defines.hpp"
#include "node_modules\@gruppe-adler\replay\ui\dialog.hpp"
```

```
// if CfgFunctions already exists, just put the #include part inside
class CfgFunctions {
    #include "node_modules\@gruppe-adler\replay\cfgFunctions.hpp"
};
```

```
class GRAD_Replay {
    precision = 5;                                    // precision of replay, 5 means every 5 seconds one snapshot (number)
    trackedSides[] = {"west", "east", "civilian"};    // defines the sides that will be tracked (possible are "west", "east", "independant", "civilian") (array)
    stepsPerTick = 1;                                 // defines steps played back at once (number)
    trackedVehicles = 0;                              // defines if empty and AI steered vehicles will be tracked (0/1)
    trackedAI = 0;                                    // defines if AI will be tracked (0/1)
    sendingChunkSize = 10;                            // higher number means replay loading is faster, but might cause instability / lags during loading (number)
    trackShots = 0;                                   // defines if shots will be tracked (0/1)
};
```
### 4. Initialize script in init.sqf
`[] call GRAD_replay_fnc_init;`

### 5. Put this where you want the replay to start (recommended: end of mission)
Must be executed on server only!
```
// stops record, sends data and starts replay
call GRAD_replay_fnc_stopRecord;

// ends mission after replay is over
[{
    REPLAY_FINISHED
}, {
    ["END1"] remoteExec ["endMission",0,false]; // your custom end mission call or whatever you want to do after replay
}, []] call CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute;
```

### Important
Currently there is **no helper function to resume normal gameplay after replay has played**, this means all assets will be frozen and TFAR spectator channel will be set for all players, furthermore every wound will be healed and all spectator cams left.

### Script commands
to pause recording, set `GRAD_REPLAY_RECORDING_PAUSED` to true on server / false to resume
